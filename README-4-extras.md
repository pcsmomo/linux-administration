## Section 23: [EXTRA] IPFS - The Interplanetary File System

### 184. What is IPFS and How It Works

- InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol designed to create a permanent and decentralized method of storing ad sharing files;
- IPFS aims to replace HTTP and build a better web

IPTF Properties:

- IPFS is a peer-to-peer, decentralized, and destributed file system;
- IPFS is a CDN
- IPFS is also fault-tolerant with zero downtime
- IPFS is consorship-resistant
- IPFS uses content address (not location address like HTTP)

#### Content Addressing vs Location Addressing

- ## Location Addressing

```sh
echo "This is just an example for IPFS." > ipfs.txt

snap install ipfs
# ipfs 0.17.0 from Leo Arias (elopio) installed
sudo ipfs add ipfs.txt
# added {HASH} ipfs.txt

# Navigate, www.ipfs.io/ipfs/{HASH}

# download it via scp
scp -P 2299 ipfs.txt root@170.64.181.165:/var/www/html
```

## Section 24: [EXTRA] Security: Netfilter and Iptables Firewall

### 188. Introduction to Netfilter and Iptables

- `Netfilter` is **software firewall, a packet filtering framework inside the Linux Kernel**
- It enables **packet filtering, NAT, PAT, Port Forwarding and packet mangling**
- Netfilter framework is controlled by the `iptables` command
- Iptables is a tool that belongs to the **user-space** used to configure netfilter
- Netfilter and iptables are often combined into a single expression netfilter/iptables
- Every Linux distribution uses netfilter/iptables, there is nothing extra that should be installed
- Only root user can use or configure the netfilter framework
